// Musa Dawodu is a 19 years old Nigerian male who lives with his parents in Lekki, Lagos State. 
// Recently, he wrote the JAMB exam and had the following scores in his combination:
// ENG - 70
// GOVT - 85
// LIT - 82
// CRK - 94
// Using the factory method, implement a createPerson() factory function that takes name, age and location as arguments.
// Afterwards, create an object representing Musa from the factory function. 
// Also, implement a factory function createJambScores() that takes eng, govt, lit, crk as arguments. 
// Then create an object representing Museâ€™s JAMB scores. 
// Add the object as a property to Musa object you created above in (a) above

//Different ways you can clone an object? Give examples for each of them.
